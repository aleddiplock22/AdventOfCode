# 2024

- Solutions for day1 in `01.go`, day2 in `02.go` etc.
- This year displaying solutions in a web app that uses templ, so to run have to `templ generate` then `go run main.go`.
- For daily problem development won't want to have to use the web app so have set up command line arg `go run main.go --day 2`.
- For daily problm benchmarking: `go run main.go --day X --bench`
- For daily problem visualisations: `go run main.go --day X --visualise` (haven't done this for every day!)
